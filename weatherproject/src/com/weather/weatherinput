Understanding How Output is Generated in a Hadoop MapReduce Job
In a Hadoop MapReduce job, the output is generated through the following phases:

Map Phase (Mapper):

During this phase, the input data is read and processed by the Mapper. The Mapper extracts relevant information from each record and emits key-value pairs.
Shuffle and Sort Phase:

After the Mapper emits the key-value pairs, Hadoop automatically performs a shuffle and sort operation. In this phase:
Hadoop groups the emitted key-value pairs by key (location in your case).
The system then sorts the values for each key before sending them to the Reducer.
Reduce Phase (Reducer):

In the Reduce phase, the Reducer processes the key-value pairs that belong to the same key (location). It performs the necessary aggregation (e.g., calculating the average temperature, humidity, and pressure for each location).
After processing the data, the Reducer writes the final output in the form of key-value pairs.
Example Breakdown Based on Your Data
Let's break down how the output is generated using the example weather data and the MapReduce program described earlier.

Sample Input Data
The input data format is semi-structured, where each record represents weather data for a specific location at a given time. The format is:
=================================================================================
timestamp,location_id=1234,temperature=25.3,humidity=78.2,pressure=1012
timestamp,location_id=1234,temperature=26.1,humidity=77.8,pressure=1011
timestamp,location_id=5678,temperature=15.5,humidity=65.4,pressure=1008
timestamp,location_id=5678,temperature=16.2,humidity=64.8,pressure=1007
============================================================================
Mapper's Output (Map Phase)
In the Mapper, we extract data from each line. For each record, the Mapper emits a key-value pair where:

Key: The location_id (e.g., 1234, 5678).
Value: A custom WeatherWritable object that contains the temperature, humidity, pressure, and a count (set to 1 for each record).
For the above input data, the Mapper will emit the following key-value pairs:
==============================================================================
Key: 1234
Value: WeatherWritable(25.3, 78.2, 1012, 1)
=============================================================================
Key: 1234
Value: WeatherWritable(26.1, 77.8, 1011, 1)
=============================================================================
Key: 5678
Value: WeatherWritable(15.5, 65.4, 1008, 1)
=============================================================================
Key: 5678
Value: WeatherWritable(16.2, 64.8, 1007, 1)
============================================================================
Shuffle and Sort Phase
In this phase, Hadoop sorts and groups the emitted key-value pairs by the key (location_id). The sorted groups will look like this:

Group 1 (Key: 1234):

(25.3, 78.2, 1012, 1), (26.1, 77.8, 1011, 1)
===============================================
Group 2 (Key: 5678):

(15.5, 65.4, 1008, 1), (16.2, 64.8, 1007, 1)
=============================================
Each group is sent to a single Reducer.

Reducer's Output (Reduce Phase)
The Reducer processes each group of key-value pairs, aggregates the data, and calculates the average values for temperature, humidity, and pressure for each location_id.

For each group:

Group 1 (Key: 1234):

For location 1234, the Reducer receives two records with the following values:
Temperature: 25.3, 26.1
Humidity: 78.2, 77.8
Pressure: 1012, 1011
Count: 1 (for each record)
The Reducer calculates the average for each parameter:

Average Temperature: (25.3 + 26.1) / 2 = 25.7
Average Humidity: (78.2 + 77.8) / 2 = 78.0
Average Pressure: (1012 + 1011) / 2 = 1011.5
The Reducer outputs the following key-value pair:
===================================================
Key: 1234
Value: 25.7, 78.0, 1011.5
===============================================
Group 2 (Key: 5678):

For location 5678, the Reducer receives two records with the following values:
Temperature: 15.5, 16.2
Humidity: 65.4, 64.8
Pressure: 1008, 1007
Count: 1 (for each record)
The Reducer calculates the average for each parameter:

Average Temperature: (15.5 + 16.2) / 2 = 15.85
Average Humidity: (65.4 + 64.8) / 2 = 65.1
Average Pressure: (1008 + 1007) / 2 = 1007.5
The Reducer outputs the following key-value pair:


Key: 5678
Value: 15.85, 65.1, 1007.5
Final Output
After the Reduce phase, the final output for the job will be written to the output directory specified in HDFS. The output will consist of key-value pairs where the key is the location_id, and the value is the aggregated weather data (average temperature, humidity, and pressure).

The output on HDFS might look like this:

================================================================
1234   25.7, 78.0, 1011.5
5678   15.85, 65.1, 1007.5
1234: This location has an average temperature of 25.7°C, an average humidity of 78.0%, and an average pressure of 1011.5 hPa.
5678: This location has an average temperature of 15.85°C, an average humidity of 65.1%, and an average pressure of 1007.5 hPa.
How to Retrieve the Output
Once the job is completed, the output is stored in the HDFS output path (e.g., /output_path). You can retrieve it using the following Hadoop command:
================================================================================
View Output in HDFS: To view the output in HDFS, use the hdfs dfs -cat command:


hdfs dfs -cat /output_path/part-m-00000
This will display the aggregated results (average weather data) for each location.

Download the Output to Local File System: If you want to download the output files from HDFS to your local file system, use the hdfs dfs -get command:


hdfs dfs -get /output_path /local_output_path
This will copy the entire output directory from HDFS to your local machine.

Summary of Output Generation
Mapper extracts and emits location_id as the key and a WeatherWritable (containing temperature, humidity, pressure, and count) as the value.
Shuffle and Sort groups the data by location_id.
Reducer aggregates the data by calculating averages of temperature, humidity, and pressure for each location_id.
The final output is a key-value pair where the key is location_id and the value is a string containing the averages of temperature, humidity, and pressure for that location.
